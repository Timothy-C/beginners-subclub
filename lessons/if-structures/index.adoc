= If Statements

Goal: To be able to implement if statements into code.

== Relational Operators

Relational operators find any similarities between two values, typically
variables. A relational operator takes two values or expressions,
compares the two, and returns a *boolean value*. A boolean value comes
in one of two states: *true or false*. For a computer, *true is stored
as a 1,* and *false is stored as a 0*.

An example of a relational operator is `==`. It checks whether two
values/expressions are equal to each other. The symbol `==` is different
from `=`, an operator only used for variable assignments. Be sure not to
mix up the two operators.

.Example Code:
[source,role="linenos"]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << (3 == 3) << endl;        // compares ints
    cout << (2.6 == 3) << endl;      // compares double and ints
    cout << ('A' == 'A') << endl;    // compares characters
    cout << (true == false) << endl; // compares boolean values
    return 0;
}
----

.Output:
....
1
0
1
0
....

NOTE: `<<` is an operator that is evaluated before relational operators.
Therefore, when outputting values with relational operators, parentheses
must surround the relational operator.

Relational operators are able to work with integers, floating numbers,
characters, and boolean values. *Values of different types can also be
compared to each other,* although computers use complicated ways to
compare variable types such as characters.

The following are more examples of relational operators.

[cols=",a,,a,a",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Symbol |Description |Examples |Result

|Not equal to
|`!=`
|Checks if two values are different
|`3 != 4` +
`5 != 5`
|`true` +
`false`

|Greater than
|`>`
|Checks if the first value is greater than the second
|`5 > 0` +
`6 > 6`
|`true` +
`false`

|Less than
|`<`
|Checks if the first value is less than the second
|`3 < 4` +
`5 < 3`
|`true` +
`false`

|Greater than or equal to
|`>=`
|Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value
|`5 >= 4` +
`4 >= 4`
|`true` +
`true`

|Less than or equal to
|`+<=+`
|Checks it the first value is less than or equal to the second value
|`+3 <= 3+` +
`+4 <= 3+`
|`true`
`false`

|=======================================================================

== Logical Operators

Multiple comparisons can be done at once by using *logical operators*.
These logical operators are used to *manipulate boolean values*,
typically boolean values returned from relational operations. For
example, a computer can check if a number is both less than a certain
value and greater than a certain value. Relational operators are
performed *before* logical operators. The following are examples of
common logical operators.

[cols=",a,,a,a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Symbol |Description |Examples |Result

|AND
|`&&`
|Returns true only if *both* sides are true
|`true && true` +
`false && true`
|`true` +
`false`

|OR
| `\|\|`
|Returns true when either side is true
|`true \|\| false` +
`false \|\| false`
|`true` +
`false`

|NOT
|`!`
|Returns true if value is false and returns false if value is true
|`!(true)` +
`!(false)`
|`false` +
`true`

|=======================================================================

.Example Code:
[source,role="linenos"]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << ((3 < 4) && (6 == 7)) << endl;
    cout << (!(!(5 != 6) || !(4 >= 4))) << endl;
    return 0;
}
----

.Output:
....
0
1
....

Try to follow the process of the computer from all the inner brackets to
the outer brackets.

== If Statements

An if statement is the simplest way of controlling the order in which
commands are executed. The order in which actions are executed is called
*control flow*. If statements basically tell the program to do a
specific set of commands if a certain condition is met.

The basic outline of an if statement looks like the following:

[source]
----
if (condition) {
    //code to be run if the condition results to true
}
// rest of the code
----

Inside the parenthesis will be a condition that will result either true
or false. Normally, the if statement will have variables being compared
using relational operators and/or logical operators. Notice how *the
condition does not need to end with a semicolon*. Inside the braces of
an if statement will be all the commands that the computer will execute
if the condition results to true. If the condition results to false,
*everything inside the braces will be skipped.* In order to make a code
file much easier to read, *indenting all commands inside an if
statement* is encouraged.

NOTE: Do not initialize a variable within an if structure and use that
variable outside the if structure. This subject will be explained in
more detail in the next chapter.

.Example Code:
[source,cpp]
----
// this code will check if a number is positive
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;            // initializes an integer variable
    cout << "Type in any number." << endl;
    cin >> num;         // gets user input
    if (num > 0) {      // all positive numbers are greater than 0
        // if num is positive, this message will be displayed
        cout << num << " is a positive number.";
    }                   // if num is negative or zero, output is skipped
    return 0;
}
----

.Sample Run:
....
Type in any number.
8
8 is a positive number.
....

In the example above, no message will appear if the number inputted is
negative or zero. In order to put a message stating that a number is
negative or zero, a second and third if statement could be added.
However, there is a cleaner way to have the program output that message.

== Else and Else if Statements

Else and Else if statements extend off the original if statement. They
make a program run a different set of commands if the conditions in an
if statement results false. An if structure that includes an else if and
else statement will resemble the following:

[source]
----
if (condition1) {
    // code to be run if condition 1 results true
}
else if (condition2) {
    // code if condition 1 results false but condition 2 results true
}
else if (condition3) {
    // more code
}
// the number of else if statements could continue...
else {
    // code to be run if all previous conditions result false
}
----

[.right.text-center]
image::media/image2.png[flowchart of if statement logic,width=142,height=156]

The program will always check the initial condition first and will check
following conditions if all previous conditions result false. For
example, if condition 2 results to true, but condition 1 also results to
true, *the program will prioritize the _first_ set of code*. Once the
program is done executing the commands inside an if, else if, or else
statement, the program will skip the rest of the if structure. This
means that if the first condition results true, the program ignores all
other if conditions inside the if structure. A program is able to have
multiple else if statements within one if structure. However, an if
structure can only have one else statement. Else if statements and else
statements are completely optional and either could be omitted from the
if structure.

Below is the same code modified to display messages for positive,
negative numbers and zero.

[source,role="linenos"]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int num;
    cin >> num;
    if (num > 0) {        // all positive numbers are greater than 0
        cout << num << " is an even number."; // skips to line 16
    }
    else if (num < 0) {   // all negative numbers are less than 0
        cout << num << " is a negative number."; // skips to line 16
    }
    else {               // 0 is neither greater or less than 0
        cout << num << " is not positive nor negative.";
    }
    return 0;
}
----

== In Summary

* Relational Operators compare two values/expressions and returns a
boolean value
* Logical Operators manipulate boolean values and return one boolean value
* Arithmetic Operators are executed before relational operators, which are
executed before logical operators
* The order in which a computer executes code is called control flow
* If statements modify control flow by giving the program extra commands
if a condition results to true
* else if and else statements can be added to an if structure
* The program, once finding a condition that results true in an if
statement, will perform all commands and immediately skip to the end of
the if structure.

== Further Reading for If Statements

=== XOR

The XOR operator (`^`) is an operator that can be used like a logical
operator.

This operator is able to take two boolean values and return true if
only one of the given values is true. If both or neither boolean values
are true, it will return false. The reason why this operator is not a
logical operator is because it is a *bitwise operator* and could be used
in scenarios beyond the scope of this chapter.

|Examples |Results

|true ^ true
|true ^ false
|false ^ true
|false ^ false

|false
|true

=== Comparing Characters

Each character has its own numerical representation. When a variable
stores a character, the variable is holding a number that corresponds to
that character. The characters and their corresponding number follows
the *American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)*. In
{cpp}, each character can be referred to by using either the character
itself enclosed by single quotation marks (`'A'`) or their numerical
representation (`65`).

A table displaying each character's corresponding number can be obtained
http://www.asciitable.com/[here]:

In the code below, the value of the character variable is set to 'A':

[source]
char var = 65;

When a character is being used with a relational operator in {cpp}, *the
numerical representation of that character is being compared* and not
the character itself. So the following two excerpts of code perform the same task:

.Example 1
[source]
----
char c = 111;

cout << (c > 'a');
----

.Example 2
[source]
----
char c = 'o';

cout << (c > 97);
----

This is how {cpp} uses characters with relational operators.

=== Switch Statements

Switch Statements are alternative ways of control flow that is used
whenever an if structure would lead to many else if statements in code.
They work in the same way as if statements but are more concise when the
number of conditions is large. It is used over an if structure whenever
the *condition is whether or not a variable is equal to a certain
value.*

A switch statement resembles the following:

[source]
----
switch (variable name) {
case possibleValue:
    // your code
    break;
case possibleValue2:
    // your code
    break;
// the number of cases may continue
default:
    // your code
}
----

In a switch statement, the `default` case acts as an else statement in
an if structure. The purpose of the break statements will be explained
in the following chapter. Switch statements are not required as they do
the same task as if structures.

.Example Code:
[source,role="linenos"]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "What's your mark?" << endl; // asks for a mark
    char mark;              // char variable to store mark
    cin >> mark;
    switch(mark){           // checks value of mark
    case 'A' :              // checks if mark == 'A'
        cout << "Amazing!"; // output if mark == 'A'
        break;
    case 'B' :              // checks if mark == 'B'
        cout << "Nice nice.";
        break;
    case 'C' :              // checks if mark == 'C'
        cout << "You're getting there.";
        break;
    case 'D' :
        cout << "Try Harder.";
        break;
    default :
        // default statement if all previous return false
        cout << "That's not a rank!";
    }
    return 0;
}
----

.Sample Case:
....
What's your mark?
A
Amazing!
....

.Sample Case 2:
....
What's your mark?
D
Try Harder.
....

.Sample Case 3:
....
What's your mark?
R
That's not a rank!
