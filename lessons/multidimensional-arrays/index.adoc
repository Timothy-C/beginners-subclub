= Multidimensional Arrays

An array can be visualized as a row of elements where each element has
its own column number (index). A regular array is usually known as a
*one-dimensional array* because every element can be placed in one row.

A multidimensional array is simply an *array of arrays.* A
multidimensional array has elements with *more than one index*. A
two-dimensional array can be visualized as rows of arrays stacked
together in order to create a grid. Therefore, each element in that
array will have both a row number and a column number. Each pair of
coordinates (row, column) will refer to a unique element in the array.
What makes a one-dimensional array different than a multidimensional
array is the number of indexes that each element has.

Two-dimensional arrays (arrays with 2 indexes) are often used whenever
variables must be organized into a grid. That way, a computer can easily
look through an entire row/column in a grid. Three-dimensional arrays
can be visualized as a cube where each index corresponds to a different
dimension of the cube.

In {cpp}, each square bracket (`[ ]`) corresponds to a separate dimension of
an array. For example, a two-dimensional array will have two sets of
square brackets. When initializing an array, the size of each dimension
of the array must be given.

[source]
arrayType arrayName [size1] [size2];

When accessing an element in a multidimensional array, the index of each
dimension must be known. Each set of indexes refers to a unique element
in an array.

[source]
arrayName[index1][index2]

NOTE: No set of square brackets can be left blank when accessing an
element in an array.

.Example code of a 2-dimensional array:
[source,role=linenos]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // the purpose of this code is to show a 4 by 4 multiplication table
    int len = 4;            // len is the size of each dimension of the array
    int grid[len][len];     // grid is a len by len 2-dimensional array
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {         // i represents the row number
        for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {     // j represents the col number
            grid[i][j] = (i + 1) * (j + 1); // assigns a value to each element
        }
    }
    cout << "Look at this Cool Multiplication Table" << endl;
    // looks at every column in each row and outputs element in array
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        for (int j = 0;j < len; j++) {
            cout << grid[i][j] << " ";  // outputs the value of the element
        }
        cout << endl;                   // skips to new line when outputting
    }
    return 0;
}

.Output:
....
Look at this Cool Multiplication Table
1 2 3 4
2 4 6 8
3 6 9 12
4 8 12 16

== In Summary:

* Arrays are used to organize multiple variables of the same type
* Each variable in an array is called an element
* Each element is ordered and given an index
* The first element of an array always has an index of 0
* The size of an array will always remain constant
* Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays, and each element in a
multidimensional array has more than one index
