= Structures

Goal: To be able to create new data types and to be able to use them in code.

Consider having a {cpp} file that organizes and stores records of student
info. Each student record will contain multiple fields of various data
types. This data can be stored by having multiple vectors that store
each field. This way of storing records is very messy.

If another student needs to be added to the list, every single vector
has to change in size. This will lead to many lines of code simply to
readjust the size of each vector.

A structure is used in order to create an *object*, a new data type that
is a collection of other data types. These other data types, called
member variables, will appear in every object. Those member variables
can be accessed through the object. In order to use this new data type,
this type must first be declared and defined.

A struct declaration will resemble the following:

[source]
struct typeName {
    member1Type member1Name;
    member2Type member2Name;
    // the number of members in the struct can continue
};

Arrays and other containers can also be placed within a structure. A
data type of a member can start off as a certain value if that value is
assigned within the struct declaration.

Once a struct has been declared, a new data type can be used across the
{cpp} file. They are initialized just like any other variable.

 typeName structName;

In order to access a specific member in a struct, a period is placed in
between the struct name and the member name.

 structName.memberName

.Example Code:
[source,role=linenos]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

struct studentInfo {     // creates struct that stores student Info
    string studentNum;  // each student will have a student number
    string firstName;   // each student will have a first name
    string lastName;    // ...
    int grade;
    int mark;
    bool isPassing;
};

int main() {
    studentInfo Thomas; // creates variable that is a studentInfo type
    Thomas.studentNum = 404;              // accesses a member of studentInfo
    Thomas.firstName = "Thomas";
    Thomas.lastName = "The Tank Engine";  // Assigns Thomas a last name
    Thomas.grade = 11;
    Thomas.mark = 44;
    Thomas.isPassing = false;

    if (Thomas.isPassing) {               // Thomas.isPassing is a boolean value
        cout << Thomas.firstName << " " << Thomas.lastName << " is passing.";
    }
    else {
        cout << Thomas.firstName << " " << Thomas.lastName << " is failing.";
    }
    return 0;
}
----

.Output:
....
Thomas the Tank Engine is failing.
....

Arrays and vectors of structures can also be used. When accessing a
member variable in an array of structures, the index of the array should
be placed before the period. (`arrayName[index].member`).

Structures are effective when organizing lists of records. Structures
must be defined within the {cpp} file it is in. Objects are not often used
in contest questions, but are widely used in large scale projects and
games. The concept of objects can be delved further into a branch of
computer science known as *object oriented programming.*

== In Summary

* Structures are used to create new data types
* Structures must first be declared and defined before use
* All variables in a structure are called member variables
* A period is used to access a member function in a struct
* Arrays of structs can be made, and structs can include arrays
